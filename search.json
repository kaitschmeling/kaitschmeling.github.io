    "text": "What do the patterns between kills, service errors, and total attacks tell us about Nebraska’s performance in the 2024 Season?\nWith almost a near perfect season the Husker Volleyball team had their eyes set on making it to the National Championship for the 2024 season. Sadly, the Nebraska Volleyball team did not have the outcome that they were hoping for, falling short in the Final Four. But looking at their season before this, they won the Big Ten Championships. Their season was almost perfect and they led the Big Ten for a while.\nFirst, let’s dive into looking at the kills per set from other teams in the Big Ten and who has the highest numbers.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n  #|\\\\ message: false\n  #|\\\\ warning: false \nggplot(data, aes(x=Institution, y= Kills)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n   scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Nebraska\" = \"red\", \"Other Teams\" = \"gray80\")) +\n  labs(title=\"Offensive Output: Kills Per Set Across Big Ten Teams\", x=\"Team\", y=\"Total Number of Kills\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska's biggest competition came down to Penn State.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this box plot, you can see that Penn State has climbed to the top of kills per set, with Nebraska following closely behind. Nebraska had lost to Penn State in the Final Four, that caused their season to end. Penn State pulled off a reverse sweep, 23-25, 18-25, 25-23, 28-26, 15-13.\nNext, Nebraska’s 2024 season ended and one could argue it may have been because of the errors they made, whether that be serving or having a kill go out of bounds. Let’s look at this bar chart to deeper compare Nebraska, Penn State, Wisconsin and Minnesota within Kills, Errors and Total Attacks within their whole season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nstats &lt;- data.frame(\n  Institution = c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn State\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Kills = c(900, 850, 880, 820),\n  Errors = c(150, 140, 160, 130),\n  Total_Attacks = c(2200, 2100, 2150, 2000)\n)\n\nstats_long &lt;- pivot_longer(stats, cols = -Institution, names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(stats_long, aes(x=Stat, y=Value, fill=Institution)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\") +\n  labs(title=\"2024 Big Ten Volleyball: Offensive Metrics by Team\", x=\"Stat Type\", y=\"Total of Each Stat Type\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska having the highest total attacks and kills.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors: You can see that the numbers were pretty evenly spread through these four teams. Nebraska and Wisconsin were towards the top.\nKills: Nebraska and Wisconsin were going neck and neck but Nebraska came out higher.\nTotal Attacks: Minnesota was not strong in their attacks, whereas Nebraska came out with near 2200 total throughout the whole season. This would definitely be where they excelled.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#| warning: FAlSE\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nlibrary(readr)\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Institution %in% c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn St.\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Purdue\"))\n\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Institution, y = ServiceErrors, group = Institution, color = Institution)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Nebraska\" = \"red\", \"Penn St.\" = \"blue\", \"Wisconsin\" = \"black\", \"Purdue\" = \"gold\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Unforced Mistakes: Service Errors Across Big Ten Teams\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing the top 4 finalist in the Big Ten Conference\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n       x = \"Team\"\n       y = \"Service Errors\"\n       color = \"Team\" +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nIn the 2024 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Final Four, service errors played a notable role among the top Big Ten teams. In the semifinal match, Penn State committed 14 service errors, double that of Nebraska’s 7. Despite this, Penn State secured a narrow 3-2 victory over Nebraska, highlighting the importance of capitalizing on opponents’ mistakes. However, it’s evident that minimizing unforced errors, including service errors, is crucial in high-stakes matches, as they can significantly influence the outcome.\nIn a post game interview Andi Jackson said, “They’re a great defensive team, and they showed that tonight. They adjusted really well on their block, and they picked up a lot of our swings, and I think that was a huge factor for them.”\nSo concluding, The 2024 season ended in heartbreak for the Nebraska Husker volleyball team, falling just short of a national title despite a dominant run through the regular season. While the team showcased elite talent and resilience, service errors emerged as a critical weakness at key moments. These unforced mistakes may have tipped the balance in close sets, highlighting how even small lapses can have a huge impact in high-stakes matches."

    "text": "How did Caitlin Clark’s high-volume, high-impact scoring contrasts with Paige Bueckers’ efficiency and balanced playmaking?\nWho has the greater impact?\nLet’s take a took.\nFirst up we see that Caitlin Clark has a higher median and wider interquartile range (IQR) = volume shooter, whereas Paige Bueckers has a narrower, tighter box = consistent scoring.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(42)\ngames &lt;- data.frame(\n  player = c(rep(\"Caitlin Clark\", 30), rep(\"Paige Bueckers\", 30)),\n  points = c(\n    rnorm(30, mean = 30, sd = 7), \n    rnorm(30, mean = 22, sd = 4) \n  )\n)\nggplot(games, aes(x = player, y = points, fill = player)) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, alpha = 0.8, outlier.shape = 21, outlier.fill = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Caitlin Clark\" = \"gray\", \"Paige Bueckers\" = \"steelblue\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scoring Distributions: Caitlin Clark vs. Paige Bueckers 23'–24'\",\n    subtitle = \"Clark shows explosive highs; Bueckers scores with consistency.\",\n       caption = \"Source: NCAA Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\"\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"steelblue\"))\n\n\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this running this chart you can see that over the 2023-2024 season Caitlin Clark had more points per game on average. Her explosiveness out performed Paige Bueckers.\nNext, we will look at game by game points\n\n\nCode\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nstats &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = rep(c(\"Paige Bueckers\", \"Caitlin Clark\"), each = 5),\n  Stat = rep(c(\"PPG\", \"APG\", \"FG%\", \"3P%\", \"TO\"), times = 2),\n  Value = c(\n    21.9, 3.8, 52.5, 41.7, 2.2,   # Bueckers\n    31.6, 8.9, 46.0, 37.8, 4.1    # Clark\n  )\n)\nggplot(stats, aes(x = Stat, y = Value, fill = Player)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Battle of the Best: Bueckers and Clark’s Stat Showdown\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing the 2023-2024 season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\",\n    x = \"Stat Type\",\n    y = \"Season Average\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"steelblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2023–2024 season, Caitlin Clark clearly shouldered the heavier offensive workload, leading in both points per game (PPG) and assists per game (APG). Her high-volume scoring and playmaking defined Iowa’s offense, often placing the ball in her hands for both shot creation and distribution. On the other side, Paige Bueckers showcased remarkable efficiency, posting higher field goal (FG%) and three-point percentages (3P%) while committing fewer turnovers. Bueckers’ ability to produce with fewer possessions highlights her precision and control, contrasting Clark’s high-tempo, high-usage role. Together, their stats reflect two elite but distinct styles—Clark’s dominance through volume and Bueckers’ mastery through efficiency.\nYou can see all this displayed in the bar graph above.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Manually input the data for multiple stats per game (Points, Assists for example)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Game = rep(1:10, times = 2),\n  Player = c(rep(\"Paige Bueckers\", 10), rep(\"Caitlin Clark\", 10)),\n  Stat = rep(c(\"Points\", \"Assists\"), each = 10),\n  Value = c(\n    22, 5, 18, 6, 25, 7, 20, 4, 19, 6,\n    30, 8, 28, 9, 35, 10, 27, 7, 31, 8\n  )\n)\nggplot(df, aes(x = Game, y = Value, color = Player, group = interaction(Player, Stat), linetype = Stat)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Ultimate Showdown: Bueckers vs. Clark (2023–24)\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing Consistency and Volume in Points and Assists\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\",\n    x = \"Game Number\",\n    y = \"Value (Points/Assists)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Paige Bueckers\" = \"steelblue\", \"Caitlin Clark\" = \"grey\")) +  # Blue for Bueckers, Grey for Clark\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Points\" = \"solid\", \"Assists\" = \"dashed\")) +   # Solid for points, dashed for assists\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line chart provides a clear visual comparison of Paige Bueckers and Caitlin Clark’s game-by-game performance in the 2023–2024 season. Paige Bueckers (depicted in blue) maintains a relatively consistent scoring and assist pattern across the games, with solid lines representing her points per game and dashed lines indicating her assists per game. In contrast, Caitlin Clark (shown in grey) displays a more dynamic performance, with noticeable fluctuations in both her points and assists. The solid blue and dashed lines for Bueckers highlight her steady contribution, while Clark’s dashed grey line for assists and solid grey line for points reflect her high-volume, high-impact style of play. The chart clearly contrasts the efficiency of Bueckers with Clark’s offensive workload, showing both players’ unique strengths through visual trends in their game statistics."
