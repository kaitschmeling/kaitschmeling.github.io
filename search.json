    "text": "With almost a near perfect season the Husker Volleyball team had their eyes set on making it to the National Championship for the 2024 season. Sadly, the Nebraska Volleyball team did not have the outcome that they were hoping for, falling short in the Final Four. But looking at their season before this, they won the Big Ten Championships. Their season was almost perfect and there stats how that. First, let’s dive into looking at the kills per set from other teams in the Big Ten and who has the highest numbers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n  #|\\\\ message: false\n  #|\\\\ warning: false \nggplot(data, aes(x=Institution, y=Kills)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title=\"Offensive Output: Kills Per Set Across Big Ten Teams\", x=\"Institutions\", y=\"Kills\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska's biggest competition came down to Penn State.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this box plot, you can see that Penn State has climbed to the top of kills per set, with Nebraska following closely behind. Nebraska had lost to Penn State in the Final Four, that caused their season to end. Penn State pulled off a reverse sweep, 23-25, 18-25, 25-23, 28-26, 15-13.\nNext, when looking how Nebraska’s 2024 season ended let’s look at this bar chart to deeper compare Nebraska, Penn State, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nstats &lt;- data.frame(\n  Institution = c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn State\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Kills = c(900, 850, 880, 820),\n  Errors = c(150, 140, 160, 130),\n  Total_Attacks = c(2200, 2100, 2150, 2000)\n)\n\nstats_long &lt;- pivot_longer(stats, cols = -Institution, names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(stats_long, aes(x=Stat, y=Value, fill=Institution)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\") +\n  labs(title=\"2024 Big Ten Volleyball: Offensive Metrics by Team\", x=\"Stat Type\", y=\"Value\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska having the highest total attacks and kills.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors: You can see that the numbers were pretty evenly spread through these four teams. Nebraska and Wisconsin were towards the top.\nKills: Nebraska and Wisconsin were going neck and neck but Nebraska came out higher.\nService Errors: This one came out pretty evenly even though Nebraska struggled with this, this season. The numbers came out to 75, 80, 70, 85 across all the four teams.\nTotal Attacks: Minnesota was no strong in their attacks, whereas Nebraska came out with near 2200 total throughout the whole season. This would definitely be where they excelled.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Institution %in% c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn St.\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Purdue\"))\n\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Institution, y = SoloBlocks, color = Institution, group = Institution)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Nebraska\" = \"red\", \"Penn St.\" = \"blue\", \"Wisconsin\" = \"black\", \"Purdue\" = \"gold\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Unforced Mistakes: Service Errors Across Big Ten Teams\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing the top 4 finalist in the Big Ten Conference\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data from class | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\")\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.\nℹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n       x = \"Team\"\n       y = \"Solo Block Total\"\n       color = \"Team\" +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nIn the 2024 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Final Four, service errors played a notable role among the top Big Ten teams. In the semifinal match, Penn State committed 14 service errors, double that of Nebraska’s 7. Despite this, Penn State secured a narrow 3-2 victory over Nebraska, highlighting the importance of capitalizing on opponents’ mistakes. However, it’s evident that minimizing unforced errors, including service errors, is crucial in high-stakes matches, as they can significantly influence the outcome."
