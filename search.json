    "text": "With almost a near perfect season the Husker Volleyball team had their eyes set on making it to the National Championship for the 2024 season. Sadly, the Nebraska Volleyball team did not have the outcome that they were hoping for, falling short in the Final Four. First, let’s dive into looking at the kills per set from other teams in the Big Ten and who has the highest numbers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n  #|\\\\ message: false\n  #|\\\\ warning: false \nggplot(data, aes(x=Institution, y=Kills)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title=\"Kills Per Set Distribution\", x=\"Institutions\", y=\"Kills\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska's biggest competition came down to Penn State.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this box plot, you can see that Penn State has climbed to the top of kills per set, with Nebraska following closely behind. Nebraska had lost to Penn State in the Final Four, that caused their season to end. Penn State pulled off a reverse sweep, 23-25, 18-25, 25-23, 28-26, 15-13.\nNext, when looking how Nebraska’s 2024 season ended let’s look at this bar chart to deeper compare Nebraska, Penn State, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nstats &lt;- data.frame(\n  Team = c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn State\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Kills = c(900, 850, 880, 820),\n  Errors = c(150, 140, 160, 130),\n  Total_Attacks = c(2200, 2100, 2150, 2000),\n  Service_Errors = c(75, 80, 70, 85)\n)\n\nstats_long &lt;- pivot_longer(stats, cols = -Team, names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(stats_long, aes(x=Stat, y=Value, fill=Team)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\") +\n  labs(title=\"Nebraska vs. Top Opponents: Key Stats\", x=\"Stat Type\", y=\"Value\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska having the highest total attacks and kills..\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 15, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors: You can see that the numbers were pretty evenly spread through these four teams. Nebraska and Wisconsin were towards the top.\nKills: Nebraska and Wisconsin were going neck and neck but Nebraska came out higher.\nService Errors: This one came out pretty evenly even though Nebraska struggled with this, this season. The numbers came out to 75, 80, 70, 85 across all the four teams.\nTotal Attacks: Minnesota was no strong in their attacks, whereas Nebraska came out with near 2200 total throughout the whole season. This would definitely be where they excelled."
