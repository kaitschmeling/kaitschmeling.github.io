    "text": "With almost a near perfect season the Husker Volleyball team had their eyes set on making it to the National Championship for the 2024 season. Sadly, the Nebraska Volleyball team did not have the outcome that they were hoping for, falling short in the Final Four. First, let’s dive into looking at the kills per set from other teams in the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\n#|\\\\ message: false\n#|\\\\ warning: false \nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"2024_big_ten_vball.csv\")\n\nggplot(data, aes(x=Institution, y=Kills)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title=\"Kills Per Set Distribution\", x=\"Institutions\", y=\"Kills\",\n       subtitle =\"Nebraska's biggest competition came down to Penn State.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Big Ten Data | By: Kaitlyn Schmeling\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this box plot, you can see that Penn State has climbed to the top of kills per set, with Nebraska following closely behind. Nebraska had lost to Penn State in the Final Four, that caused their season to end."
